* Step 1: create a variable called `words` that points to an empty array.

* Step 2: Create a for loop, inside that loop create a prompt that takes in comma separated data.  ie: Your prompt can say, "Please enter an adjective and a noun, separated with a comma!"

  * Hint: you will need to use the `split` function to separate your data. Google, how do I take in comma separated data in a prompt?"

* Step 3: Create a variable called `sentence` that utilizes your `words` data and outputs a semantic sentence.

* Step 4: Alert your sentence to the screen.
