### Instructions

* Create a variable called `adjectives` that points to an empty array.

* Create a for loop that prompts the user to "Enter an adjective", 3 times.

  * Hint: you have to use the `push` function. Google, "how do I add data to an array using prompt?"

* Create a variable called `sentence` that concatenates your adjectives into a semantic sentence. ie: "The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

* Alert your sentence to the page!
